*Hello everyone, welcome to Zul'Gurub. This is a 20-man raid instance, and we're going to be facing a variety of bosses and trash packs. Please make sure you have your consumables ready and your gear repaired. Let's stick together, communicate, and we'll get through this. Remember, we're all learning, so patience is key.*

**High Priestess Jeklik (Bat Aspect):**
"First up is High Priestess Jeklik. She has two phases. In the first phase, she'll be on the ground. We need to interrupt her heal and spread out to avoid her AoE silence. In the second phase, she'll fly up and summon bats. We need to group up, AoE the bats down, and avoid the bombs she drops."

**High Priest Venoxis (Snake Aspect):**
"Next is High Priest Venoxis. He'll start with a snake form and then transform into a humanoid. In his snake form, avoid standing in front of him due to his poison spit. In his humanoid form, he'll put a poison debuff on random players. Healers, be ready to cleanse it."

**High Priestess Mar'li (Spider Aspect):**
"High Priestess Mar'li is next. She'll summon spiders that we need to AoE down. She'll also use a life drain spell that needs to be interrupted. If you get web wrapped, call it out so we can free you."

**Bloodlord Mandokir (Raptor Boss):**
"Bloodlord Mandokir is a tough one. He'll randomly 'watch' players. If you're being watched, stop all actions to avoid his deadly strike. He'll also level up each time he kills a player, so let's try to keep deaths to a minimum. His raptor, Ohgan, will also attack us, but we'll kill him first to make the fight easier."

**High Priest Thekal (Tiger Aspect):**
"High Priest Thekal is our next boss. He and his two adds need to be killed at the same time, or they'll resurrect each other. We'll split the raid into three groups to handle each target. He'll also go into a tiger form and charge players, so healers, be ready."

**High Priestess Arlokk (Panther Aspect):**
"High Priestess Arlokk will vanish and summon panthers. We need to kill these panthers quickly. When she reappears, she'll target a player and deal heavy damage. That player needs to kite her around while we DPS her down."

**Jin'do the Hexxer:**
"Jin'do the Hexxer is next. He'll put a curse on players that needs to be removed quickly. He'll also summon shades that we need to kill. In the second phase, he'll chain players to the ground. Free those players and avoid standing in the large purple AoE."

**Hakkar:**
"Finally, we have Hakkar. He'll siphon life from us, but if we've killed all the previous bosses, he won't get their powers. He'll also put a poison DoT on players that needs to be cleansed. In the second phase, he'll mind control players. We need to CC and cleanse those players."


**Trash Packs:**
"Throughout the instance, we'll encounter various trash packs. Let's make sure to CC as needed and focus our DPS. Remember, some of these packs can be just as dangerous as the bosses, so don't underestimate them."

**Conclusion:**
"Alright, that's the rundown of Zul'Gurub. Let's stay focused, communicate, and we'll get through this. Let's do our best and have fun. Any questions?"
